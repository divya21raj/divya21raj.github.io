    "bio": "I've been coding for the last 5 years, starting with C/C++, moving on to Java, and then Python and JS. I've made some cool projects as I went along, solidifying my understanding of everything I learnt. \nCurrently, I'm pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Shiv Nadar University, graduating in 2020.\n I have three internships under my belt and three of my apps are currently on the Play Store. I've just got into ML and AI and planning to make some kickass projects there as well...\nI've always been a fan of video games and it's infact my love for games that got me into CS. Even though I'm much busier now, I'll always find time for a good game....\nRecently, I've also developed an interest in learning various languages. I spend my free time honing my Korean, Spanish and Telugu. I can only get better at them :)\nContact me on any of my socials for work related stuff or just general chit chat... I'm all ears.",
