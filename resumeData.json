    "bio": "I've been coding for the last 9 years, starting with C/C++, moving on to Java, and then Python and JS. I've made some cool projects as I went along, solidifying my understanding of everything I learnt. \n\n I have professional experience from working at Dell and then at Goldman Sachs, which I am currently building upon as a graduate student in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My current interests lie in scalable software systems, and how we can design, create, test and maintain them. \n\nI got my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Shiv Nadar University, graduating in 2020. I have two prior internships under my belt and three of my apps are currently on the Play Store.\n\nI've always been a fan of video games and it is in fact my love for games that got me into CS. Even though I'm much busier now, I'll always find time for a good game.... \n\nAlong with that I enjoy reading about history and non-fiction in my free time. Recently, I've also developed an interest in learning various languages. I spend my free time honing my Korean, Spanish and Telugu. I can only get better at them :)\n\nContact me on any of my socials for work related stuff or just general chit chat... I'm all ears.",
